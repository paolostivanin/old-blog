title: '[Algorithms] Brute Force approach'
subtitle: 'What is the brute force approach? Which algorithms use that method?'
---

It has been a long time since my last article but (finally!) I've found some spare time to write this one.\\
Some days ago I thought: "I'd like to brush up my algorithms and data structures knowledge so, why not to write a post about every argument I'll review?"\\
And here I am, writing the first of a long series of articles about this interesting and (very!) important topic.\\
If you're wondering what I'm gonna write about in the coming weeks, then I'm sure you want to have a look at the schedule below :-)

* Brute Force:
    * Introduction
    * Selection Sort
    * Bubble Sort

* Divide and Conquer:
    * Introduction
    * Merge Sort
    * Quick Sort

* Decrease and Conquer:
    * Introduction
    * Binary Search
    * Insertion Sort
    * DFS
    * BFS

Before ending the above schedule I will write a new article containing the new list of arguments that will be treated.

Ok, enough words. Let's start with a brief introduction of what "brute force approach" means and then let's move on what the selection sort is and how it works.
