It has been a while since the last time I wrote something here, what a shame!  
In my defense, I can say that a lot of things have happened during these months, but I hope I will be able to write some compelling posts before the end of the year.  
Actually, I really have a lot of ideas (and drafts :-P) on some arguments that I think could be really interesting to write about.

**SPOILER ALERT**: Ops, did I just write GTK+, Rust, algorithms and data structures? ;-)

Stay tuned!
