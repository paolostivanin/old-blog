When I woke up in the morning of the 13th of January, I didn't know that everything would be changed.

I was studying when, at 11:57am, I received an e-mail from a CERN recruiter. I opened it thinking that it could have been only a negative confirmation of a previous application. But, when I read the first line of the message body, I didn't belive what I was reading.

**OH MY GOD.**

I've been accepted for the Technical Student Committee held by the CERN. It will last for 12 months, starting on February 2015 (maybe the 9th).

**And what will I do at CERN?**<br>
In short, I will be in team who is responsible for providing CPU resources to the experiments, specifically for the Tier-0 (see [here](http://home.web.cern.ch/about/computing/grid-system-tiers) and [here](http://home.web.cern.ch/about/computing) for more informations about the different levels of Tier). These resources are now running on their OpenStack driven internal cloud infrastructure. Moreover, I know that I will use [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) and [Foreman](http://puppetlabs.com/) but, for now, I don't know much more.
